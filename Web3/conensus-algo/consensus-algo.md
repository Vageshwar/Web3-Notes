### What is Consensus mechanisms
` Consensus mechanisms is a complete stack of protocols, idea and incentives that enable a distributed set of nodes to agree on the state of a blockchain `

These are just components in consensus mechanisms that protect against Sybil attacks.

`Sybil attack`: Sybil attacks refer to individual humans tricking a system into thinking they are multiple people to increase their influence.

Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake-based consensus mechanism that derives its crypto-economic security from a set of rewards and penalties applied to capital locked by stakers. This incentive structure encourages individual stakers to operate honest validators, punishes those who don't, and creates an extremely high cost to attack the network.
